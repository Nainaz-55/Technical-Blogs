#### **Project Overview**

Clients are seeking an experienced Apigee developer to design, implement, and manage an enterprise-grade **API Gateway** using **Apigee Edge, Apigee Hybrid, or Apigee X**. there company provides a **multi-cloud SaaS solution** for financial services, requiring a **secure, scalable, and high-performance** API management platform.

The project will involve:

1. **Designing and implementing** an Apigee API Gateway for managing public and private APIs.
    
2. **Security enforcement** through OAuth 2.0, JWT validation, API keys, and mutual TLS (mTLS).
    
3. **Performance optimization** using caching, rate limiting, and load balancing.
    
4. **Automation and DevOps** integration via CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and monitoring.

### **Project Scope**

#### **1\. API Gateway Design & Setup**

* Architect an **Apigee Gateway** for managing 50+ APIs across multiple environments (dev, staging, production).
    
* Implement **proxies, shared flows, and API bundles** for efficient API routing.
    
* Ensure **high availability and scalability** using Apigee's cloud-native features.
    
* Configure **multi-region deployment** with failover strategies.
    

#### **2\. Security & Access Control**

* Enforce **OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials, Password, and Authorization Code Grant)** for secure API access.
    
* Configure **JWT validation** with a third-party Identity Provider (IdP) like Okta or Azure AD.
    
* Implement **mutual TLS (mTLS)** authentication for internal APIs.
    
* Set up **API key-based authentication** for public API consumers.
    
* Develop a **custom threat protection policy** to mitigate OWASP API security risks.
    

#### **3\. Performance Optimization & Traffic Management**

* Enable **API caching** with configurable TTL values to reduce backend load.
    
* Implement **rate limiting and quota policies** to prevent API abuse.
    
* Configure **load balancing strategies** across backend microservices.
    
* Optimize API request/response transformations using **message processors and compression policies**.
    

#### **4\. CI/CD & Automation**

* Implement a **CI/CD pipeline** for API deployment using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
    
* Use **Apigee Maven Plugins** for automating proxy deployments.
    
* Automate API policy configuration using **Terraform or Apigee API Management APIs**.
    
* Set up **unit tests and integration tests** using Postman or Newman.
    

#### **5\. Monitoring, Logging & Analytics**

* Configure **Apigee API Analytics** dashboards for real-time traffic monitoring.
    
* Integrate **logging solutions** (ELK Stack, Stackdriver, or Splunk) for API request tracking.
    
* Implement **custom alerting mechanisms** for API failures and latency issues.
    
* Provide detailed **API usage and error reports** for business stakeholders.
