Below are the key differences based on deployment model, runtime location, and so many..

### **1\. Deployment Model**

| Platform | Deployment Type |
| --- | --- |
| **Apigee X** | Fully managed (SaaS) on Google Cloud |
| **Apigee Hybrid** | Control plane in GCP, runtime on-prem or other cloud |
| **Apigee Edge Cloud** | Fully managed by Apigee (SaaS) |
| **Apigee Edge Private Cloud** | Self-managed, installed on-premises |

---

### **2\. Runtime Location**

| Platform | Runtime Location |
| --- | --- |
| **Apigee X** | Google Cloud only |
| **Apigee Hybrid** | On-premises / other clouds |
| **Apigee Edge Cloud** | Apigee-hosted cloud |
| **Apigee Edge Private Cloud** | Customer data center |

---

### **3\. Management and Maintenance**

| Platform | Who Manages? |
| --- | --- |
| **Apigee X** | Google |
| **Apigee Hybrid** | Shared (Google manages control plane, customer manages runtime) |
| **Apigee Edge Cloud** | Apigee |
| **Apigee Edge Private Cloud** | Customer |

---

### **4\. Integration with GCP**

| Platform | GCP Integration |
| --- | --- |
| **Apigee X** | Native integration with GCP (IAM, VPC, BigQuery, etc.) |
| **Apigee Hybrid** | Partial GCP integration |
| **Apigee Edge Cloud** | Minimal to no GCP integration |
| **Apigee Edge Private Cloud** | No native GCP integration |

---

### **5\. Networking and Security**

| Platform | Security Features |
| --- | --- |
| **Apigee X** | VPC Service Controls, CMEK, private ingress |
| **Apigee Hybrid** | Security managed by customer on runtime |
| **Apigee Edge Cloud** | SSL/TLS, but less granular control |
| **Apigee Edge Private Cloud** | Full security control to customer |

---

### **6\. Use Case Fit**

| Platform | Best For |
| --- | --- |
| **Apigee X** | Cloud-native enterprises on GCP |
| **Apigee Hybrid** | Regulated industries needing on-prem runtime |
| **Apigee Edge Cloud** | Quick-to-deploy SaaS API management |
| **Apigee Edge Private Cloud** | Legacy or tightly regulated environments needing full control |

Let’s explore the above with a simple real-life example.

### **Imagine You Run an API Company**

You need to **manage and secure APIs** for your mobile app, website, and partners. Depending on your needs and environment, you can pick from four versions of Apigee:

---

### **1\. Apigee X (Fully Cloud - Google manages everything)**

* **Example**: You’re a startup or company already using Google Cloud.
    
* You don’t want to worry about installing or maintaining anything.
    
* You just want to deploy APIs and start using them with **auto-scaling, security, logging** etc.
    
* **Google manages everything** – infrastructure, updates, scaling.
    

**Use Case**:  
You deploy your APIs on Google Cloud and everything just works.

---

### **2\. Apigee Hybrid (Mixed – You manage part, Google manages part)**

* **Example**: You work in a **bank or hospital** where API traffic/data **must stay inside your company** (for security reasons).
    
* But you still want to use Google's powerful API management dashboard, analytics, and control plane.
    
* So:
    
    * **Google** manages the "control" (tools, dashboard, analytics, etc.).
        
    * **You** install and manage the runtime (gateway that handles API calls) **on your own servers** – either on-prem or in AWS/Azure.
        

**Use Case**:  
You keep customer data in-house but use Google's tools to manage APIs.

---

### **3\. Apigee Edge Cloud (Old Cloud Model)**

* **Example**: You want a cloud solution but don’t care which cloud.
    
* Apigee (not Google) manages everything for you.
    
* You don’t get tight integration with Google Cloud features.
    

**Use Case**:  
Before Apigee X existed, this was used to manage APIs without hosting anything yourself.

---

### **4\. Apigee Edge Private Cloud (Fully On-Prem - You manage everything)**

* **Example**: You are a **government agency or defense company** that doesn't trust cloud.
    
* You want to install and run **all components on your own servers** – control + runtime.
    
* You are responsible for **installing, updating, scaling, security, and everything**.
    

**Use Case**:  
You want **full control and zero cloud dependency**.

### Summary Table:

| Feature | Apigee X | Hybrid | Edge Cloud | Edge Private Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Who manages it? | Google | Shared (you + Google) | Apigee (now Google) | You |
| Where is it hosted? | Google Cloud | Control on GCP, runtime on your side | Apigee cloud | Your servers |
| GCP integration | Full | Partial | None | None |
| Ideal for | Cloud-native teams | Regulated industries | Simple cloud users | High-security orgs |

I hope this blog will help you understand the difference between Apigee X, Apigee Hybrid, Apigee Edge Cloud, and Apigee Edge Private Cloud.
