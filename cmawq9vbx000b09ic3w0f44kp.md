As an Apigee Developer, I worked on a critical initiative that transformed how we connect internal investment with external providers— a leading alternative asset management SaaS platform.

This blog walks you through what the project was about, the architecture, the challenges, and the solutions we built using Apigee Edge.

## 🌐 The Business Context

Citi Global Wealth Investments (CGWI) had a vision: to become the premier provider of alternative investment products to high-net-worth clients. To do this, we needed a seamless digital platform that could:

* Allow relationship managers and investment counselors to browse, launch, and transact on alternative funds
    
* Integrate tightly with iCapital’s fund marketplace.
    
* Eliminate manual fund subscription and reporting workflows
    
* Be accessible only from Citi’s internal network across regions (NAM, EMEA, APAC)
    

This is where the Apigee API Gateway came in — acting as the secure bridge between Citi and iCapital.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

Here’s how everything fits together:

* Citi’s internal platforms: Tradelink and GAMS (used by bankers, ICs, and Ops)
    
* External platform: iCapital, offering fund APIs and SFTP endpoints
    
* API Gateway: Citi’s on-prem Apigee Edge, managing all API traffic, authentication, and security
    
* SSO integration using SAML 2.0 federation for Citi users to access iCapital fund profiles
    
* Encrypted data exchanges (including encoded Swiss account numbers for compliance)
    

Apigee edge acted as the secure mediator between two isolated worlds.

## 🔧 My Role as an Apigee Developer

I was responsible for building the full API integration layer using Apigee Edge. My responsibilities included:

✅ Designing and deploying Apigee API proxies to handle:

* Browser-based (SSO) traffic from Tradelink to iCapital’s UI using SAML 2.0
    
* Machine-to-machine backend APIs using OAuth 2.0 (client credentials grant)
    

✅ Building integrations for:

* Ingesting fund master data, documents, and performance metrics from iCapital to Citi (GET APIs + SFTP polling)
    
* Sending client account data, entitlement mappings, and transaction requests to iCapital (POST/PUT APIs)
    

✅ Implementing security policies in Apigee:

* OAuth 2.0 token validation
    
* TLS encryption
    
* Spike arrest and quota management
    
* Data masking and account-level encoding for Swiss clients and so on,.
    

✅ Automating deployments:

* CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Bitbucket, RLM, Change Request and Apigee Management APIs for Dev → UAT → Prod deployments
    

✅ Enabling compliance:

* Ensured all integrations adhered to Citi’s data privacy policies
    
* Applied encryption for sensitive fields (PII, account numbers)

## 💡 Key Achievements

* ⏱️ Reduced fund subscription processing time by 60% through automated API flows
    
* 🔁 Enabled real-time fund data and entitlement sync across Citi systems
    
* 🔐 Delivered secure SSO access to iCapital fund profiles from Citi intranet — improving client servicing
    
* 📈 Helped boost Citi’s Alternatives investment revenue by enabling faster transactions and reporting

## 🧰 Tools & Tech Stack

* Citi’s on-prem Apigee edge (API Gateway)
    
* OAuth 2.0, SAML SSO
    
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
    
* Bitbucket CI/CD, Jenkins, RLM, CR, Harness, Tekton
    
* JavaScript, JSON, XML
    
* Postman, cURL
    
* TLS encryption
    
* SFTP for file exchange
    

## Why Apigee Edge (Private Cloud) Was the Right Fit for Citi

Unlike Apigee X or Apigee Hybrid, which run on public or hybrid cloud environments, Citi’s API Gateway infrastructure is powered by Apigee Edge deployed entirely within its own private network.

Here’s why this matters:

* 🔐 Full Control & Security: Since Apigee Edge is hosted on Citi’s internal infrastructure (private cloud), it gives the bank complete control over the platform — from API traffic handling to policy enforcement — without relying on external cloud providers.
    
* 🧱 Behind the Firewall: The API Gateway and all API proxies run securely within Citi’s own network perimeter. No API traffic ever leaves Citi’s infrastructure unless explicitly routed to a trusted SaaS endpoint like iCapital.
    
* ✅ Regulatory Compliance: Operating in multiple regions like NAM, EMEA, and APAC means Citi must comply with strict data privacy and residency laws. An on-premises gateway ensures that sensitive data (like client account numbers or transaction logs) stays within Citi-controlled systems unless encrypted and approved for transmission.
    
* 🔄 Gateway Flexibility: Apigee Edge gave us the ability to implement OAuth 2.0, SAML SSO, TLS encryption, quota enforcement, and routing logic — all within the scope of Citi’s compliance and risk controls.

## ✍️ Wrapping Up

This project was a perfect mix of API gateway architecture, cloud integration, and security governance. It showcased how powerful Apigee edge can be when used not just for routing traffic — but for solving real-world enterprise integration challenges at scale.
