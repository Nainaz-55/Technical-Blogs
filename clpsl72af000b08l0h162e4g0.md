In this blog, we are going to learn how to upload a project into GitHub using Git commands.

### **Step 1**

* Log in to your GitHub account.
    
* Create a new Repository and give any name to your repository related to your project.
    
* Add the description if needed.
    
* select public or private as per your opinion.
    
* You can select **Add a README file**, gitignore template if you want.
    
* Click on **Create Repository.**

### Step 2

* If git is not downloaded, download it from the below link and install it on your system.
    
    [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    

* Open the command prompt and run the `>git` command to check whether Git is downloaded properly or not.  
    if you get the below data, the Git is downloaded successfully.

### Step 3

* Go to your project folder. And right click on it

* Click on the **Show More option** -&gt; **Open Git Bash here.**
    
* Now we are inside our project folder.

* The git init command is used to create a new blank repository. It is used to make an existing project as a Git project. It creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory.  
    Run this command in git `$git init` .

    .git folder will track down all the changes that are happening in your projects.
    
* The git status command is used to show the status of the git repository. This command displays the state of the local directory and the staging area.  
    Run the below command in git to see the status of the git.  
    `$git status`

    The files that are in red have not yet been added to your repository. once it is added it will turn to green.
    
* we can add files one by one or we can add all the files at a single time.  
    if you want to add a single file you can use `$git add fine_name`  
    if we want to add all files at a time you can use `$git add .`

* **There are three stages in Git**.  
    1\. Adding: files are ready to get commit.  
    2\. committing: files got saved.  
    3\. pushing: pushing to remote repository.
    
* `$git commit -m "commit message"`

* To connect the local repository(folder/file where actual files are stored in the local system) with the remote repository(GitHub repository).  
    You have to copy the below command from the GitHub repository and paste it into a git bash.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1701791167731/26b97b1c-7069-4738-ab24-7ce1b512bd6c.png align="center")
    
    And run the command in git bash.  
    `git remote add origin` [`https://github.com/Nainaz-55/Analog-Clock.git`](https://github.com/Nainaz-55/Analog-Clock.git)
    
* To push the files into a remote repository. run the below command in git bash  
    `git push -u origin master` (*we haven't selected any branch. so we have to use "master")*  
    it will ask for the login credentials of github.

    Click on **Sign in with a code.** And give the login credentials of the GitHub where you created the repository to upload the project and the code that you got to authorize.

* Finally, the files were successfully pushed into the remote repository.
